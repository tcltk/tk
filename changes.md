Release Tk 9.0.2 arises from the check-in with tag `core-9-0-2`.

Tk 9.0.2 continues the Tk 9.0 series of releases.  The Tk 9.0 series
does not support Tcl 8.6.  The Tk 9.0 series extends the Tcl 9.0 series.
To make use of Tk 9.0.2, first a Tcl 9.0 release must be present.
As new Tk features are developed, expect them to appear in Tk 9, but not
necessarily in Tk 8.

Tk patch releases have the primary purpose of delivering bug fixes
to the userbase.

Tk patch releases have the primary purpose of delivering bug fixes

some incomplete features first delivered in Tk 9.0.0.
