	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: Fix sh quoting error reported in
	bash-3.1+ [Bug 1377619] (schafer)

2003-02-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: correct HP-UX ia64 --enable-64bit build flags

2002-11-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkTextDisp.c (TkTextSeeCmd): handle see for unmapped
	text displays. [Bug #641778]

	************************
	****  8.3.5 TAGGED  ****
	************************

	* changes: updated for 8.3.5 release

	* win/tkWinPort.h (tchar.h): Do not include on Cygwin.
	(_T): Define for Cygwin.
	(OPEN_MAX): only define if currently undefined.
	* win/winMain.c (main): Conditionally define. [Patch #625283] (khan)

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Set CFLAGS to "" if the user did not set
	CFLAGS in the env. This keeps AC_PROG_CC from adding "-g -O2" to
	the CFLAGS by default. (dejong)
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Check for bug in Cygwin version
	of windres and work around that case by passing a POSIX path
	instead of a Windows native path. One can't always pass a POSIX
	path because the mingw native toolchain accepts only Windows
	native paths. [Patch #625283] (dejong)

2002-10-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/imgPhoto.test:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoConfigureMaster): fix arg handling
	for missing -format or -data options. [Bug #624974]

2002-10-11  Joe English  <jenglish@flightlab.com>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c: (rev. 1.8.1.3) Backported changes for
	TIP 107 ("Fix the 2-second raise delay") to core-8-3-1-branch 
	[Patch #601518]
	* tests/unixWm.c (unixWm-51.7): added 200 ms delay after
	'raise' and 'lower' commands, since these are now asynchronous.
	(NB: there may be other regressions, this is the only one
	I encountered)

2002-10-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/grid.test:
	* generic/tkGrid.c: The grid size was not updated properly
	when removing a widget from a grid. [Bug #621241] (forssen)

	* generic/tkCanvas.h: moved TkColormapData struct to tkCanvPs.c
	* generic/tkCanvPs.c (TkImageGetColor): corrected bogus use of
	TkColormapData on Windows (Windows now requires RGB pixel data
	from image).
	* win/tkWinImage.c (XGetImage, XGetImageZPixmap): added support
	for generating ps for embedded widgets on canvases on Windows,
	tested for 8, 16, 24 and 32-bit depths (XGetImageZPixmap not used).

	* unix/configure: regen
	* unix/tcl.m4: replaced SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG with a more intelligent
	SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS that takes yes|no|mem|all as options now.

2002-07-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/tk.tcl (RestoreFocusGrab): handle the case where the
	FocusGrab info is not set. [Bug #553283]

2002-07-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/canvas.test: added canvas-14.[1-6]
	* generic/tkCanvas.c (CanvasWidgetCmd): corrected handling of
	'scan' subcommand args.  Also removed early return cases to goto
	done instead where the canvasPtr would be Tcl_Release'd.  This may
	solve other problems with unreleased canvasPtr's. [Bug #581560]

2002-06-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/console.tcl: corrected the defaultPrompt substitution
	[Bug #553207] and made Tab a default expansion key (like Escape).

2002-06-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Removed unnecessary dependence of tktest
	* unix/tkAppInit.c:	executable on the tcltest executable on
	Unix.  If there are similar dependencies on other platforms, they
	can probably be removed as well.  [Bug 572134].

2002-05-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tkMacInit.c:
	* mac/tkMacResource.r: include msgcat package in resources
	as bgerror depends on it. Restores ability of mac static
	build to run standalone (except for encoding file issues).

2002-04-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: change HP-11 SHLIB_LD_LIBS from "" to ${LIBS} so
	that the .sl knows its dependent libs.

2002-04-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4: Enabled COFF as well as CV style debug info with
	--enable-symbols to allow Dr. Watson users to see function info.
	More info on debugging levels can be obtained at:
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvc60/html/gendepdebug.asp

2002-04-10  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Added missing $(TKSTUBLIB) to the
	install-binaries target and added a special rule for tkStubImg.c
	so it always is built with _DSTATIC_BUILD for use in the Stubs
	library.

2002-04-08  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tkInt.h:
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c: fixes to MSL stdin/stdout hookup to the
	TkConsole when using shared MSL libraries; fix for crashing
	bug on exit: writing to stdin/sterr when console has already
	been destroyed. (both fixes need support in MSL, see 
	'CW Pro6 changes' in tcl/mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx)
	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: fixes to Navigation Services Dialog filter.
	* mac/tkMacDraw.c: add panic for overwide TkImages that would
	crash Tk on mac otherwise.

2002-03-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreask_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Added inclusion of <arpa/inet.h>. This fixes
	  a GCC/HPUX problem with missing a "htons". See also
	  "tclUnixPort.h" for equivalent code.

2002-03-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: added shell and gdb targets, prevent
	tkIntXlibDecls.h header from being installed by install-libraries.
	* unix/configure: 
	* unix/configure.in: backported improved AIX build support from 8.4.
	* unix/tcl.m4: backported 8.4 changes to HP-UX, IRIX64-6.*, SunOS,

	detect when we build against a Tcl build dir.  Compile with
	-DUSE_TCL_STUBS in the shared case.

2002-01-31  Todd Helfter <tmh@users.sourceforge.net>
	* generic/tkMenu.c (ConfigureMenuCloneEntries)
	* tests/menu.test (menu3.68)

	* generic/tkBind.c (TkBindFree):
	* generic/tkGrid.c (Tk_GridCmd,ResolveConstraints,CheckSlotData,
	DestroyGrid):
	* generic/tkSelect.c (Tk_DeleteSelHandler,TkSelDeadWindow): Replaced

2001-12-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/event.test (event-click-drag-1.2): Corrected test that
	failed on Solaris/CDE due to text scrolling.  [Bug 413735]

	* library/demos/rolodex: Minor updates.
	* library/demos/square: A bit of tidying up...
	* library/demos/tcolor: Rewrote to remove uses of [case], brace-up
	expressions, and not rely on the lines of rgb.txt being well-
	formatted lists!
	* library/demos/timer: Uses [clock clicks -milliseconds] now which

	* generic/tkImgPPM.c:
	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c:
	* generic/tkMenu.c: Applied patch [461578], provided by Vincent

	  channel the image is supposed to be read from.

2001-08-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (ChooseDirectoryHookProc): work-around for MS
	bug that caused crashing in tk_chooseDirectory on Win95.
	[Bug #224936] (baker)

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (TkWmRestackToplevel): reworked how
	ConfigureNotify requests were handled in relation to the parent to
	avoid the problem with potential 'raise' delays on some wms.
	[Bug #220260] (baker) wms that were affected should notice the
	difference in tests unixWm-51.* not failing that failed before.

2001-08-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Initialize): added call to Tcl_SetMainLoop.
	This only has effect when tclsh is run (not wish), and then Tk is
	loaded in interactively.

2001-08-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/unixFont.test (unixFont-2.[234]): fixed to be more
	sensitive on systems that have more installed fonts.

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): changed to use
	Tcl_EventuallyFree instead of ckfree so that widgets that have
	references to a tkwin can use them.

	* generic/tkCanvBmap.c:
	* generic/tkCanvLine.c:
	* generic/tkCanvPoly.c:

	Create<Item> functions that could lead to ABRs or FMRs and
	corrected names of argc/argv to objc/objv.

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (Mgetc): corrected screwy use of ternary
	operator and possible FMR.

	* tests/listbox.test: 
	* generic/tkListbox.c: made use of Tcl_Preserve/Tcl_Release to
	prevent FMR errors in Display functions.
	* generic/tkEntry.c: corrected missing Tcl_Release that caused
	font not freed complaints when trying valid cleanup calls.

	* generic/tkEntry.c (DestroyEntry): used Tcl_EventuallyFree
	instead of ckfree for entryPtr to prevent FMRs. [Bug #413904]

	* unix/tkUnixScale.c (TkpDisplayScale): corrected FMR when scale
	was deleted while calling its command.

2001-08-24  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-08-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure: regenerated
	* win/tcl.m4: fixed DLLSUFFIX definition to always be ${DBGX}.dll.
	This is necessary for TEA compliant builds that build shared
	against a static-built Tk.
	* win/Makefile.in ($(WISH)): added $(TK_STUB_LIB_FILE) to build
	target, otherwise it wouldn't get generated in a static build.

2001-05-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/aclocal.m4: sync'ed up IRIX config with tcl changes.
	[Bug #424748]

        ** Mac 8.3.3 binary release

        **  detailed change log for changes to mac code for 8.3.3
        **  (expands on log entries below marked 2001-04-04  Jeff Hobbs)

	* mac/tkMacShLib.exp: removed file

	* mac/MWTkBuildLibHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkBuildLibHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TkHeaderCommon.h:
	* mac/MW_TkOldImgStaticHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkStaticHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkStaticHeader.pch: new precompiled header files

	* mac/MW_TkHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TkOldImgHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TkTestHeader.pch: revised precompiled header handling: now
	include a common header file 'MW_TkHeaderCommon.h' from all .pch files,
	the .pch files themselves now only setup #defines (e.g. BUILD_tk,
	STATIC_BUILD, TCL_DEBUG, TCL_THREADS) like in makefiles on other
	platforms.

	* mac/tkMac.h:
	* mac/tkMacPort.h:
	* mac/tkMacInt.h: use of BUILD_tk and TCL_STORAGE_CLASS like on other
	platforms, standardize #include'd files to what's done on other
	platforms, removed use of #pragma export, changed extern to EXTERN
	where appropriate to enable DLL export via the TCL_STORAGE_CLASS
	mechanism.

	* mac/tkMacAppearanceStubs.c: removed use of #pragma export

	* mac/widget.r: new resource file for 'Widget Demos'

	* mac/tkMacProjects.sea.hqx: updated mac build project files:
	- build support for CodeWarrior Pro6, UnivIntf 3.4 & shared runtime
	libraries (see Tcl ChangeLog for details).
	- changed weak linking so that CFM68k binaries now work on all OS
	versions from the free 7.5.5 onwards, with or without AppearanceMgr
	and/or NavigationMgr installed.
	- added target to automatically build 'Widget Demos'

	* generic/tkInt.decls:
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tkIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tkStubInit.c:

	* mac/tkMacInt.h: MAC_TCL tk stub support was badly broken due to
	multiply defined (mac specific) names in tk.decls and tkInt.decls,
	removed the duplicates from the internal unsupported interfaces
	"interface tkInt" and "interface tkIntPlat"; moved declaration of
	TkpIsWindowFloating from tkMacInt.h to tkInt.decls: interface tkIntPlat.
	- these changes to the stub tables might require you to recompile your
	Tk extensions if they turn out to reference one of the removed routines
	in the wrong table (should be unlikely).

	* generic/tkMain.c: MAC_TCL: workaround for broken/non-standard isatty
	on MW Pro6, #include <unistd.h> instead of defining isatty
	
	* generic/tkPointer.c: MAC_TCL: #include tkMacInt.h

	* generic/tkStubLib.c: MAC_TCL: removed obsolete special casing of mac
	headers, standardize #include'd files to what's done on other platforms

	* mac/tclets.r:
	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c:
	* mac/tkMacScrlbr.c:
	* mac/tkMacMenu.c:
	* mac/tkMacMenus.c:
	* mac/tkMacFont.c:
	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: 
	* mac/tkMacButton.c: renamed obsolete apple API names to modern
	equivalents; UH3.4 support: added #include <ControlDefinitions.h>;
	fixed munged non-ASCII chars in sources due to bungled latin1<->mac
	roman encoding in CVS repository.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: added support for -filetypes option (fix for bug
	tcl #221636); added update event handling for background windows while
	in a NavigationMgr dialog; fixed nasty bug when calling CustomGetFile
	(missing addr operator) (fix for bug tk #220911 & tcl #219367); renamed
	routines conflicting with standard MoreFiles headers (see Tcl ChangeLog
	for details)

	* mac/tkMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tkMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tkMacResource.r: fixed obsolete copyrights/dates in version
	strings, updated version strings to standard usage, added support for
	'(Support Libraries)' subfolder for shared runtime libraries in
	unmerged binaries, commented out demo setting of "Tcl Environment
	Variables"

	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: 
	* mac/tkMacMDEF.r: changes to support MW Pro 6 68k compiler producing
	different offset to start of MDEF; fix to static 68k presence testing
	when calling the custom MDEF

	* mac/tkMacWm.c.c:
	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c: added/fixed AppearanceMgr checks; override
	AppearanceMgr version detection on static 68k to ensure static 68k Wish
	runs on PPCs with recent AppearanceMgr

2001-04-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/canvas.test: marked canvas-13.1 knownBug
	* generic/tkCanvas.c (CanvasEventProc): reverted 2001-04-02 canvas
	changes back because it lead to cached fonts not being freed.  The
	changes were correct for the bug, but the problem is that the
	needed Tcl_EventuallyFree will sometimes not get called until the
	whole app is being destroyed and thus the font panic is invoked.

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4: added -link50compat

	* win/tkWinX.c (GenerateXEvent): set xkey.numbytes = 0 for
	MouseWheel event processing.

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c: Corrected support for iso10646 (X11 Unicode)
	fonts on Unix. This adds a ucs-2be (UCS-2 Big Endian) encoding in
	Tk on Unix that is used for those fonts (X11 requires
	big-endianness). (welch) [Patch #406411; Bug #220890 #220899]
	Added alias for jisx0201* fonts to jis0201 encoding. [Bug #414033]

	* mac/tkMacProjects.sea.hqx: this was accidently swapped with the
	tcl project files.

	* tests/listbox.test: labelled listbox-27.1 knownBug as it isn't
	really fixed.
	* generic/tkListbox.c: reverted listbox back to 8.3.2 version
	because the fixes weren't 100% correct for the problem.

	activity
	* generic/tkEntry.c (DestroyEntry, EntryEventProc): fixed the

2001-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

2000-11-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinButton.c:
	* win/tkWinDialog.c:
	* win/tkWinScrlbr.c:
	* win/tkWinWm.c: fixed up code for Win64 support.  This mostly
	remains in _WIN64 #ifdef's, until updated compilers are standard.

	* win/tcl.m4:
	* win/makefile.vc: updated for Win64 compile support

2000-11-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameW, GetFileNameA,
	Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): created
	work-around for change in NT5.0/98 that caused no initialdir
	setting to open the browser up in the user's documents dir.

	* tests/color.test: marked color-2.6 nonPortable as we can't
	reliably assume what 'red' maps to.

2000-11-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Added branch for 0 return from
	CommDlgExtendedError() switches; this was formerly treated as an
	error, but it actually is not, since it just means the user hit
	cancel or closed the dialog.  (GetFileNameW): Added better smarts
	such that -multiple is not considered a valid option for
	tk_getSaveFile.
	Removed CommDlgExtendedError() checks for color and choosedir
	dialogs, and removed all except the explicit invalid filename
	checks for the file dialogs.
	
2000-10-30  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/configure.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rc/tk.rc:
	* win/rc/tk_base.rc (new):
	* win/rc/wish.rc: Added logic to derive filenames better in the 
	resource scripts based on compile options along with better
	support for building a static wish shell with cursor resources.

2000-10-27  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: added support for AIX-5.

	* tests/tk.test: 
	* doc/tk.n: updated to reflect default on status of useinputmethods.
	* library/tk.tcl: tk useinputmethods is set to 1 by default.  This
	enables Kanji and dead-char input by default.  Intro'd in
	1999-12-16 with default off to avoid some problems with older X
	servers that would slow down widget creation over time.

	* win/Makefile.in (test, winhelp, tktest): corrected the
	TCL_LIBRARY path specification.

2000-10-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinDraw.c (RenderObject): Applied patch from [Bug: 6368],
	which corrects rendering of 1-pixel wide stippled lines on Windows.

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c (DisplayLine): Applied patch from 
	[Bug: 6368], corrects bugs relating to use of active- and
	disabledwidth values for displaying lines (disabledwidth was never
	used, and activewidth/disablewidths would only possibly be used
	when greater than default width, rather than when simply not equal
	to default width).

	* win/tkWinDialog.c (GetFileNameW, GetFileNameA, 
	Tk_ChooseColorObjCmd, Tk_ChooseDirectoryObjCmd): Added error
	checking for the return value from the common dialog functions, so
	that the commands will not silently fail if the common dialog
	returns an error. [Bug: 6369].

2000-10-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkConfig.c (Tk_InitOptions): Added
	Tcl_IncrRefCount/Tcl_DecrRefCount calls on valuePtr, to prevent
	memory leaks when the value object comes from the option
	database.  [Bug: 6275].

2000-10-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (cat32.${OBJEXT}): add win/ subdirectory to
	cat32 target to correctly find the source file.

2000-10-04  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkGeometry.c (Tk_MaintainGeometry): Added a check for
	the case in which the slave window is a direct descendant of the
	master window.  In this case, we need not set up the additional
	infrastructure normally provide by Tk_MaintainGeometry, because we
	can rely on the parent/child relationship to handle it for us
	implicitly.  In this case, Tk_MaintainGeometry just calls directly
	to Tk_MoveResizeWindow.  This allows geometry managers to simply
	always use Tk_MaintainGeometry to maintain geometry for slaves,
	and avoid doing the direct descendant check themselves.
	(Tk_UnmaintainGeometry): Added a matching check for the direct
	descendant case; in this case, Tk_UnmaintainGeometry simply
	returns immediately.

2000-09-29  D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com>

	* generic/tkBitmap.c: Changes to prevent a BadMatch error from the
	Xserver when the same bitmap is used on two or more screens of the
	same display.

	* tests/menu.test: Print a warning if the TK_ALT_DISPLAY environment
	variable is not configured so as to test for the bug fix above.

	* library/tk.tcl (::tk::SetGrabFocus): "Catch" the grab in case
	another application already holds the grab and the "grab" command
	fails.

2000-09-29  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: commented use of TESTFLAGS
	* unix/Makefile.in: added TESTFLAGS to test and testlang targets to
	conform with Windows makefile and TEA style.

2000-09-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* doc/HWNDToWindow.3: 
	* doc/GetHWND.3: Changed synopsis to indicate the tkPlatDecls.h
	should be included, not tk.h.

	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: Removed #include <windows.h> for Windows,
	a better solution for now is to update the docs and have extension
	authors #include <tkPlatDecls.h>.

	* generic/tk.h: Removed '#include "tkPlatDecls.h"', as the
	incorrect inclusion order between windows.h/tkPlatDecls.h causes
	build conflicts on Windows.

	* generic/tkPlatDecls.h: Added #include <windows.h> for Windows,
	so that HWND, etc., are defined properly.

2000-09-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/makefile.vc (install-libraries): 
	* win/Makefile.in (install-libraries): 
	* unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Added tkPlatDecls.h to
	list of header files to install.

	* generic/tk.h: Added #include "tkPlatDecls.h", which declares the
	platform specific component of the public Tk stubs API's.

2000-08-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (DrawWindowsSystemBitmap): Use scratchDC
	for determining the source's logical coordinates.  Patch from 
	[Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (SetDefaults): Compute the indicatorDimensions[]
	under Windows NT/2000 in the same way as under Windows 95/98.
	Patch from [Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): Added a memset() to
	pacify memory checkers.  Patch from [Bug: 6134 (Markus Oberhumer)].

2000-08-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c (ImgPhotoGet): Removed redundant call to
	DitherInstance; this call was formerly being made from
	ImgPhotoGet->ImgPhotoConfigureInstance->DitherInstance, and
	ImgPhotoGet->DitherInstance.  The second call was removed.

2000-08-08  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	8.3.2 RELEASE finalized

	* changes: updated for release notes version of ChangeLog

2000-08-05  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (cat32.${OBJEXT}): corrected where to find cat.c
	given the change in default def'n of TCL_SRC_DIR.

	* win/tcl.m4: changed references from 8.4 to 8.3 (leftover from a
	backported file).

	* library/safetk.tcl: rationalized the setting of tk_library when
	initialized Tk in a safe interpreter.

2000-08-04  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* BACKPORTED FROM 8.4 (HEAD) BRANCH:

	* tests/button.test:
	* generic/tkButton.c: Added -activeforeground, -activebackground
	for labels, for the -state option.

	* doc/label.n: Added -disabledforeground to list of options [Bug:
	6053].

	* tests/focus.test (focusSetupAlt): removed wm withdraw from proc
	as it would cause a hang for tkwait visibility

	* tests/menu.test:
	* generic/tk3d.c:
	* generic/tkColor.c:
	* generic/tkCursor.c: corrected handling of 3DBorder, Cursor and
	Color objects on multiple screens. [Bug: 5454]

	* generic/tkCursor.c: Added initialization for nextPtr field of
	TkCursor, patch from Nijtmans/Howlett.

	* canvas.test: added test for 5783.
	* generic/tkCanvPoly.c (DisplayPolygon): added checks for the
	polygon fillGC not being empty to prevent segfault. [Bug: 5783]

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Applied patch from Jan Nijtmans to fix a
	problem with the GIF writing code [Bug:	5823].
	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Changed defines for GIF87a/GIF89a to be
	static char arrays with integer initialization, to address EBCIDIC
	vs. ASCII encoding issues and to handle compilers that don't deal
	with "\xAB" syntax for specifying hex values in strings.

	* generic/tkMenu.c (DeleteMenuCloneEntries): Applied fix from
	[Bug: 5275], which corrected a segfault-causing indexing problem
	when deleting entries from torn-off menus.

	* generic/tkPlace.c (Tk_PlaceCmd): reworked place master/slave
	table init'n to prevent seg fault when using place on multiple
	displays.

	* tests/text.test: Added tests for -regexp -nocase searches with
	backslash character classes.
	* tests/text.test: Added tests for searching when text is elided.
	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Text search did not work
	properly when -regexp and -nocase were used, in combination with
	backslash character classes represented by capital letters (ie,
	\W, \M); altered implementation of -regexp -nocase searches to use
	new regexp interfaces to fix this problem.  [Bug: 5988].
	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Text search was not returning
	the correct index when the search covered (but did not search)
	elided characters; corrected this by adjusting the match index by
	the number of elided characters preceeding the start of the match,
	just as is done with embedded windows, etc. [Bug: 5470].
	* generic/tkText.c (TextSearchCmd): Added a test for a NULL
	segment pointer when doing backwards searches for "" on an empty
	text widget. [Bug: 6007].

	* library/focus.tcl: fixed calling of takeFocus proc [Bug: 5372]

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (ReconfigureWindowsMenu): Added MF_GRAYED bit
	for disabled menu entries, to ensure that those which are drawn by
	the system are shown grayed (such as entries on menubars) [Bug: 4372].
	* win/tkWinMenu.c (ReconfigureWindowsMenu): Added code to add the
	MF_SEPARATOR bit for SEPARATOR_ENTRY menu items.  This causes
	separator entries on the system menu to be drawn correctly [Bug: 5451].
	* win/tkWinMenu.c (GetMenuSeparatorGeometry): Tweaked height
	requested for separator bars to be (linespace - (2*descent))
	instead of just (linespace); this makes the separator occupy a
	more correct amount of vertical space. [Bug: 5303].

2000-07-20  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tkConfig.sh.in:

	* generic/tk.decls: added Tk_PostscriptPhoto

	* generic/tkConfig.c (DoObjConfig): removed direct setting of
	interp->result.

	* mac/tkMacWm.c (Tk_WmCmd): initialized gotToplevel in
	colormapwindows case (bug found by Reasoning, Inc's automated code
	testing).

2000-04-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/mkLinks: 
	* doc/GetHWND.3: Man page for Tk_GetHWND [Bug: 1863].

	* unix/mkLinks: 
	* doc/HWNDToWindow.3: Man page for Tk_HWNDToWindow [Bug: 1869].

	* unix/mkLinks: 
	* doc/AddOption.3: Man page for Tk_AddOption [Bug: 1854]

2000-04-22  Jim Ingham	<jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c (Tk_MacGetOpenFile): Add empty bodies for the 
	"-initialfile" and "-defaultextension" options.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c (NavServicesGetFile): Only cons the result up
	into a list if multiple is true.

	* mac/tkMacMenus.c (SourceDialog): Use the "tk_getOpenFile"
	instead of hand-coding the dialog with StandardGetFile.  This way
	we get the Navigation dialogs for free.

	* doc/getOpenFile.n: Document the -multiple and -message flags
	which are only implemented on the Mac.  Also note that the -title
	works on the Mac with Nav Services installed.

2000-04-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/WinViewable.3: 
	* unix/mkLinks: Removed docs for Tk_IsViewable.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Removed calls to Tk_IsViewable.

	* generic/tkUtil.c: 
	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: 
	* generic/tkCmds.c: 
	* generic/tk.decls: Removed Tk_IsViewable function (it was not
	actually needed).

2000-04-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/aclocal.m4: made SC_PROG_TCLSH search specifically for
	tclsh*.exe type files to find an executable.

	* win/Makefile.in: fixed up cleanup, winhelp, cat32 targets

	* library/console.tcl: made console use systemfixed font on Win

	* generic/tkEntry.c: removed unnecessary ENTRY_VALIDATE #define

2000-04-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkRectOval.c (ConfigureRectOval): Added checks for valid
	outline settings before creating of outline GC; this means that it
	is really possible now to have an oval or rectangle with no
	outline.  [Bug: 5029].

2000-04-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/choosedir.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::chooseDir::Config):
	* library/tkfbox.tcl (::tk::dialog::file::Config): removed the
	extraneous glob on -initialdir after file isdir already returned 1
	and moved cd trick into this case as the else already uses [pwd].
	[Bug: 5181]

	* win/winMain.c: moved extern call out of WinMain func

	* README:
	* generic/tk.h:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tk.spec:
	* win/configure.in: bumped to version 8.3.1

	* library/msgbox.tcl (tkMessageBox): changed to use grid in some
	places, realign icon to anchor nw.

	* mac/tkMacScale.c: reverted tkMacScale.c to 1.5 equivalent (it
	was accidentally bumped forward).

2000-04-18  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed Mod2Mask in TkWinGetModifierState to
	ALT_MASK, to fix some event problems [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

	* win/tkWinX.c: Changed Mod2Mask in GetState to ALT_MASK, to fix
	some event problems [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

	* generic/tkInt.h: Moved definition of ALT_MASK and META_MASK here
	so that it would be accessible from other modules than tkBind.c.

	* generic/tkBind.c: Added code in BindEvent to check for ALT_MASK
	and META_MASK in the event state field, as this field may not be
	set up with the correct display modifier mask bits if the XEvent
	structure was created by [event generate] or by the Windows X
	emulation. [Bugs: 1160, 5088].

2000-04-18  Scott Redman  <redman@HILO>

	* win/tk.rc:
	* win/wish.rc:
	* win/wish.ico:  Modified copyright dates in Windows resource
	files.  Updated the icon for wish.exe.

2000-04-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Added checks for visibility of parent window
	before creating MessageBox and ChooseColor dialogs; this prevents
	the application from locking when the parent is withdrawn and the
	message box is created.  In these cases, the window will be
	created without a parent.

	* unix/mkLinks: Added WinViewable.3.

	* tests/msgbox.test: Added tests for patch from [Bug: 4997].

	* library/msgbox.tcl: 
	* library/dialog.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4997]; detaches
	dialog window from parent if parent is not viewable.

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Removed workaround from [Bug: 4370]; this
	is superceeded by patches to dialog.tcl.

	* generic/tkCmds.c: Changed WinfoObjCmd to use Tk_IsViewable
	function to determine visibility of windows instead of inlining
	the code.

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkDecls.h: 
	* generic/tk.decls: Added Tk_IsViewable declaration.

2000-04-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/text.tcl: Tweaked double-/triple-click selection;
	previously, anchor and insert marks were placed in unexpected
	locations following a double or triple click.  Now they are placed
	logically.  Also tweaked the extension of selection via
	shift-double-clicks so that it no longer selects the contiguous
	whitespace on the side of the selection opposite the
	double-click. [RFE: 4253].

	* doc/menu.n: Added note regarding rendering of
	checkbuttons/radiobuttons in menubars on different platforms --
	some systems do not draw indicators for check/radiobuttons in
	menubars.

	* library/menu.tcl: Corrected behavior of
	checkbuttons/commands/radiobuttons in menubars [Bug: 630].

	* tests/grid.test: Added test for [grid propagate . 0] to not toggle.
	
	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bogus logic in [grid propagate] that
	caused [grid propagate . 0] to act as a toggle instead of an
	absolute set. [Bug: 2286].

2000-04-16  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinColor.c (FindSystemColor): correct calculation of
	colors when shifting value. [Bug: 4919]

2000-04-16  Jim Ingham   <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacPort.h: protect against strncasecmp already defined -
	it is in the Pro5 version of MSL.

	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c (GenerateKeyEvent): Check for a null tkWin.
	If the hidden window we use for double-buffering controls manages
	to percolate to the top (should never happen, but...) this will
	keep us from crashing.

	* mac/tkMacButton.c (InitSampleControls): Hide the
	double-buffering window BEHIND the first "." window you can find.
	This will keep it from ever being the front window, and thus a
	black hole for events.  * mac/tkMacButton.c (ButtonEventProc):
	Disable the controls when the window is in the background.  This
	is required by the MacOS HIG. This doesn't always get called when
	it should, it still needs more work.

	* mac/tkMacDialog.c: Pretty substantial rewrite to include
	Navigation Services support for systems which have it.

2000-04-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Added check for ASCII delete character in
	KeycodeToKeysym, to fix [Bug: 5090].  See comment in code for more
	information.

	* generic/ks_names.h: Added Scroll_Lock and Sys_Req definitions.

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Changed implementation of KeycodeToKeysym,
	et. al., to use a keycode table for lookups; this will result in
	faster keycode -> keysym translations for non-ASCII keys like
	Control, Alt, etc.

2000-04-14  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c (WmProc): added check in WM_MOUSEACTIVATE so we
	correctly activate native menus when clicking in when we didn't
	have focus [Bug: 2272]

	* generic/tkCanvas.c (CanvasEventProc:2451): corrected cast

	* generic/tkEntry.c (Tk_EntryObjCmd): adjusted finishing error
	cases and changed TK_CONFIG_NULL_OK to TK_OPTION_NULL_OK

	* tests/scale.test:
	* generic/tkScale.c:
	* generic/tkScale.h:
	* unix/tkUnixScale.c:
	* mac/tkMacScale.c: moved (PixelToValue|ValueToPixel|SetScaleValue)
	to tkScale.c.  Caused an associated variable to be immediately set
	[Bug: 4833]

	* library/scale.tcl (tkScaleActivate): reduced number of scale
	redisplays by checking current value of state before setting it
	again.  [Bug: 4191]

	* tests/winDialog.test: tk_chooseDirectory seems to get a noop
	from GetOpenFileName in the static build, hanging some tests.
	The tests were fixed to timeout (noop cause unknown).

	* unix/aclocal.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): enhanced the detection of
	pthread_mutex_init [Bug: 4359] and (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS) added
	--enable-64bit-vis switch for Sparc VIS compilation [Bug: 4995]

2000-04-13  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Added smarts to check whether the left or right
	Control, Shift, or Alt key was pressed.  [Bug: 870].

	* win/tkWinMenu.c: Corrected code that created separator items on
	menus; originally, it requested that the system be responsible for
	drawing those items, so it would ignore configuration items like
	the widget background.  Now, we draw the separators ourselves (as
	we do with every other kind of menu item already). [Bug: 1166].

	* win/tkWin3d.c: 
	* unix/tkUnix3d.c: Applied patch from [RFE: 2501]: adds more
	sophisticated smarts to TkpGetShadows, so that the highlight of a
	very bright color is actually distinguishable from the color, and
	the shadow of a very dark color is similarly distinguishable from
	the color.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c: Applied patch from [Bug: 4202]; adds a check
	for NULL tkwin in Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw.

2000-04-12  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* test/winClipboard.test:
	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinClipboard.c (UpdateClipboard):
	* win/tkWinX.c (GenerateXEvent): added updatingClipboard tsd and
	TkWinUpdatingClipboard accessor function to allow us to flag
	ourselves when we are the ones updating the clipboard.  This
	corrected inability to create our own clipboard types within a Tk
	application.  [Bug: 2338 4318]
	* win/tkWinTest.c (TestclipboardCmd): improved TestclipboardCmd
	with better error handling and obj'ification

2000-04-11  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* msgcat.n: Added docs for new behavior from patch in [Bug: 4158].

	* msgcat.test: Added tests for new behavior from patch in [Bug:
	4158].
	
	* msgcat.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4158], which enables
	msgcat::mc to search the entire namespace ancestry chain for
	message translations (ie, first it checks the current namespace,
	then the parent, then the parent's parent, etc).  Also allows the
	specification of additional args for msgcat::mc; if extra args are
	given, the [format] command is used to substitute the additional
	args in the translated message.

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Moved check for withdrawn state after check
	for tkerror; this was causing problems when tkerror was used.

2000-04-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/bgerror.tcl: Added check for withdrawn state of . and
	unsetting of transient bit for .bgerrorDialog if . is not
	viewable; this protects against the application hanging on systems
	like Windows, where transient windows are withdrawn with their
	parents. [Bug: 4370].

	* tests/event.test: Added test for [event generate $widget
	<Alt-z>] [Bug: 4611].

	* tests/choosedir.test: Changed "namespace import ::tcltest" to
	"namespace import -force ::tcltest".

	* win/tkWinKey.c: 
	* unix/tkUnixKey.c: 
	* mac/tkMacKeyboard.c: Changed InitKeymapInfo to
	TkpInitKeymapInfo. [Bug: 4611].

	* generic/tkStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tkIntDecls.h: Re-gen'd from tkInt.decls.

	* generic/tkInt.decls: Added TkpInitKeymapInfo to list of function
	decls.

	* generic/tkBind.c (HandleEventGenerate): Added code to initialize
	keymap info if necessary, and to correctly set modifier bits in
	XEvent structure create to handle [event generate] calls.
	Previously, the alt/meta bits were not set correctly, so [event
	generate $widget <Alt-z>] would always fail. [Bug: 4611]

2000-04-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkGrid.c (InitMasterData): fixed uninit'd data in
	GridMaster struct [Bug: 4387]

	* library/safetk.tcl (disallowTk): made disallowTk work in the
	simple case.

	* library/comdlg.tcl (tkFocusGroup_In): fixed key navigation
	problems in dialogs under CDE [Bug: 2960]

	* tests/winDialog.test: removed knownBug constraint from 5.16

	* win/tkWinFont.c (GetScreenFont): corrected adjustment against
	LC_FACESIZE limitation for NT [Bug: 4931]

	* win/makefile.vc (TKTEST_OBJS):
	* win/Makefile.in (TKTEST_OBJS): moved tkWinTest.c from normal
	objs to TKTEST_OBJS where it belonged.

2000-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkTest.c: fixed incorrect platform inclusion for
	TkplatformtestInit (it would never get called).

	* unix/Makefile.in (MAN_INSTALL_DIR): patch to accept --mandir
	correctly [Bug: 4085]

	* library/clrpick.tcl (tkColorDialog_Config): error now thrown
	when -initialcolor "" specified. [Bug: 4198]

2000-03-31  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/DrawFocHlt.3: doc name correction

	* generic/tkEntry.c: set TK_OPTION_NULL_OK bit on -invcmd option
	and removed #ifdef ENTRY_VALIDATE expressions

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuInvoke): corrected naming of tearoffs
	[Bug: 4506]

	* library/tkfbox.tcl (tkIconList_Goto): caused browsecmd to be
	called in tkIconList_Select.  This causes the entry to be set
	properly when using the type-in-name-in-listbox bindings.

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: added unicode-aware open/save file dialogs

	* win/tkWinFont.c (TkpFontPkgInit): move private ref to platformId
	to TkWinGetPlatformId

	* win/tkWinMenu.c (SetDefaults): moved private use of versionInfo
	to TkWinGetPlatformId and removed all code for
	(versionInfo.dwMajorVersion < 4) (== Win32s)

	* win/tkWinX.c:
	* win/tkWin32Dll.c: moved TkWinGetPlatformId to tkWinX.c
	* win/tkWinInit.c: added TkWinXInit to TkpInit to ensure that its
	called for static Windows shells. [Bug: 3647]

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinX.c:
	* win/tkWinDraw.c (SetUpGraphicsPort): 
	* win/tkWinScrlbr.c (UpdateScrollbar): removed use of tkpIsWin32s

	* win/tkWinInt.h (TkWinDCState struct): added bkmode value
	* win/tkWinDraw.c (TkWinGetDrawableDC, et al): added support for
	properly transparent dashed lines on Windows. [Bug: 4617]

2000-03-30  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Fixed some ANSI specific bits to avoid
	compile problems with non-ANSI compilers (ie, replace const with
	CONST, etc).  [Bug: 4223].

	* unix/configure.in: Applied patch from [Bug: 4237]; ensures that
	srcdir is fully qualified.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Applied patch from [Bug: 4237]; if tcltest was
	not compiled, make test/tktest failed.  Now it has a rule to build
	tcltest if it has not been built.

2000-03-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Moved an overlooked tkFDialog* function in
	::tk::dialog::file namespace.

	* tests/unixWm.test: Added tests for memory leak conditions in
	tkUnixWm.c.

	* tests/canvas.test: Added test for bad configuration options on
	empty and non-empty canvas.

	* generic/tkCanvas.c: Removed bad code in CANV_CONFIGURE block of
	CanvasWidgetCmd; this was causing non-empty canvases to improperly
	handle bad configuration options [Bug: 4456].

2000-03-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c: Applied patch from [Bug: 4405]; fixes memory
	leak in Unix wm command.

2000-03-24  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/filebox.test: 
	* tests/choosedir.test: Updated tests.

	* library/xmfbox.tcl: Updated to stash data array in
	::tk::dialog::file namespace instead of in global namespace.

	* library/tkfbox.tcl: Extended some functions to support creation
	of a choosedir dialog, to allow greater code reuse between the two
	dialogs.  Moved tkFDialog* functions into a namespace
	(::tk::dialog::file).  Because these are private Tk functions (and
	should thus not be used directly by users), this should not impact
	anybody (the tk_getOpenFile and tk_getSaveFile commands still
	exist at the global scope).

	* library/tk.tcl: 
	* library/tclIndex: Updated function names for tkFDialog*
	functions and choosedir functions.

	* library/choosedir.tcl: New and improved implementation of
	tk_chooseDirectory dialog.  Based on tk_getOpenFile dialog.

2000-03-23  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c: 
	* generic/tkInt.h: Updated Tcl_OptionCmd -> Tcl_OptionObjCmd

	* generic/tkOption.c: Tcl_Obj'ectified the "option" command.

2000-03-22  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/listbox.tcl (tkListboxCancel): Added a check for empty
	string value for tkPriv(listboxPrev).  Without this check, it's
	possible to get a stack trace under certain conditions. [Bug: 4373].

2000-03-15  Sven Delmas  <sven@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinDialog.c: Changed the behavior for the
	tk_chooseDirectory dialog under Windows. Instead of trying to
	return the currently selected listbox entry (which didn't work in
	case the user selected the initial directory anyway), we now
	return the value shown in the entry. This seems to be in
	accordance with the expected behavior for this dialog.

2000-03-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/choosedir.test: Marked test 3.1 and 3.2 as bad until the
	issue with those tests on IRIX can be determined.

2000-03-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 4155]; protects
	against grabs on non-viewable windows.

2000-03-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/choosedir.test: Modified test 3.1 (-mustexist works) to be
	more careful about cleaning up its potentially troublesome after 
	events.

2000-03-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/button.test: 
	* generic/tkButton.c: Added -disabledforeground/-state to labels.

2000-03-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/entry.test:
	* generic/tkEntry.c (EntrySetValue): malloc the value when
	validating because validation could cause the pointer to become
	invalid.  Also fixed configure to not trigger focus-based
	validation.  Improved use of Tcl_WrongNumArgs. [Bug: 4320]

2000-03-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Added a check in tkMenuFirstEntry that changes
	menu behavior to only auto-post an immediate child cascade if we
	are currently on a menubar menu.  This prevents massive
	auto-cascading in cases where the first entry of the cascade is
	itself a cascade, and the first entry of that cascade is a
	cascade, and the first entry of that cascade is a cascade
	... [Bug: 676].

	* generic/tkOldConfig.c: Added check for NULL tkwin value in
	Tk_ConfigureWidget [Bug: 4079]

	* generic/tkWindow.c: Added check for NULL tkwin value in
	Tk_NameToWindow [Bug: 4079]

2000-03-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/color.test:
	* xlib/xcolors.c (XParseColor FindColor):
	* win/tkWinColor.c (XAllocColor): Fixed bit fiddling for colors to
	return "correct" values for color mapping. [Bug: 4282]

	* unix/Makefile.in (SCRIPT_INSTALL_DIR): removed extraneous '/'
	* unix/aclocal.m4: corrected TCL_NEEDS_EXP_FILE to be 1 for AIX

	* win/tkWinInt.h: change extern to EXTERN for TkWinChildProc
	declaration with extra #defs. [Bug: 4240]

	* library/focus.tcl: fixed tkFocusOK to protect $w in
	uplevel with list. [Bug: 4208]

	* doc/CrtItemType.3: fixed docs for Tk_CreateItemType to reflect
	changes made in 8.3.0 (but old style would still work as well).
	[Bug: 4252]

	* tests/config.test: extra test to check object cleanup when
	destroying the widget
	* generic/tkListbox.c (DestroyListbox): fixed crash in
	DestroyListbox due to null tkwin.  [Bug: 4207]

	* tests/entry.test: added test suite for entry validation
	* doc/entry.n: improved docs discussing caveats and gotchas when
	mixing textvar with widget validation
	* generic/tkEntry.c (EntryValidateChange): improved handling of
	validation with relation to -textvariable.  Previously, it would
	turn off whenever the textvar was set.  Now it will it will turn
	off only when the textvar is set and validation returns 0.  Added
	%V (type of validation occuring) to %-subs to help work with
	trickier validation.

2000-03-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/clrpick.test: 
	* library/clrpick.tcl: Added code to make color chooser dialog
	inherit screen setting from parent (bug #2334)

2000-02-25  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c (RaiseWinWhenIdle): Checked for the possibility
	that the window could be destroyed (can occur with
	wm deiconify .toplevel; destroy .toplevel).

2000-02-25  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c: Applied "spirit of" the patch in 1605 (the
	submitted patch was more complicated than necessary and did not
	extend to writing GIF's, only reading), to allow reading/writing
	of GIF files on EBCDIC and other non-ASCII based systems.

2000-02-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tk.spec: RPM specification for producing a binary Tk RPM
	for Linux.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added rpm target to generate Tk
	binary RPM.

2000-02-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	8.3.0 RELEASE

	* changes: updated for 8.3.0 release

	* generic/tkImgGIF.c (FileReadGIF): added cast for trashBuffer

	* generic/tkIntXlibDecls.h:
	* generic/tkInt.decls: declared some Xlib emulation calls for
	the Mac

	* generic/tkFrame.c (TkInstallFrameMenu): added extra panic to
	inform user of bad call when framePtr is NULL [Bug: 2530]

	* generic/tkMenu.c (DestroyMenuInstance): Placed checks around
	menu name objects before trying to incr the ref.  [Bug: 3402]

	* generic/tkTest.c: removed USE_OLD_IMAGE def for Mac

	* library/listbox.tcl:
	* library/text.tcl: added support for <4> and <5> for mousewheel
	style scrolling on Unix for mice that map to these buttons.

	* tests/scrollbar.test: fixed check of testmetrics command to
	allow unix tests to run (testmetrics is mac/pc only)

	* unix/tkUnixWm.c (Tk_CoordsToWindow): qualified delete of error
	handler as the goto label is reached from above and below.

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/aclocal.m4: cleaned up macros to coincide with tcl.m4,
	added -export-dynamic to LDFLAGS for FreeBSD-3+ [Bug: 2998]

	* unix/README:
	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): removed porting.notes and porting.old
	from distribution and CVS.  The information was very outdated.  Now
	refer to http://dev.scriptics.com/services/support/platforms.html

	* xlib/xgc.c: #def'd out XDrawSegments for the Mac, and added
	some extra include info for the Mac

2000-02-09  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tkMacButton.c: Stop removing the appearance window from the
	Window List.  It is not clear why Ray did this, and it causes the
	Appearance manager to crash at random times.
	
	* mac/tkMacWM.c: Add support in unsupported1 style for the Appearance
	specification of window styles, including floating window support.
	* mac/tkMacWindowMgr.c: Operate on the front non-floating window,
	unless the mouse is directly over the floating window.  Also,
	keystrokes go to the front non-floating window.
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c: Initialize floating window support.
	* mac/tkMacScrlbr.c:
	* mac/tkMacmenu.c: Fixes for floating windows - operate on the 
	FrontNonFloatingWindow.
	* mac/tkMacLibrary.r: Fix typo in File info string.
	* mac/tkMacApplication.r: Fix typo in file info string.  Add
	Finder balloon help for no apparent reason.
	
	* mac/tkMacSubwindows.c: Change panic in tkMacGetDrawablePort to
	Debugger.  This is only a temporary fix.  The panic is only
	triggered when a safeTk interpreter is torn down, and ignoring it
	does no harm.  I haven't figured out how to avoid it yet, however.
	Also use the Appearance MoveWindowStructure call when available.
	
	New Files:
	* MW_TkOldImageHeader.h: Handle #defining USE_OLD_IMAGE for tkImgPPM.c.
	* MW_TkTestHeader.h:
	* MW_TkTestHeader.pch:
	* MW_TkHeader.h: Add separate prefix files for test & release
	versions of Tk, so we can just have separate targets w/o having to
	edit files.
	
	* tclets.r: The D&D Tclets icon in rez form so we can have a
	target for this.

	The above are curtesy of Daniel Steffen (steffen@math.mq.edu.au)
	
	* tkMacAppearanceStubs.c: Stubs of the Mac Appearance calls I use
	so I can link the static 68K Shell without putting ifdef's all
	over the code.

	* mac/tkMacKeyboard.c:

	* win/tkWinKey.c: Fix for keyboard handling of "dead" keys and
	caps lock from Peter Spjuth. [Bug: 4105 3359 2493]
	Split functions into platform specific files:
	Static functions GetKeySym(), SetKeycodeAndState() and InitKeymapInfo()
	from tkBind.c moved into platform files tkWinKey.c tkUnixKey.c and
	tkMacKeyboard.c.  GetKeySym() and SetKeycodeAndState() renamed to 
	Tkp* and made public (as private functions) in tkInt.decls.

	Step 2, fixes in tkWinKey.c
	New static function: KeycodeToKeysym(), based on XKeycodeToKeysym()
	but with different arguments, and a lot of improvements.
	TkpGetString() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym() + other fixes.
	TkpGetKeySym() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym() + other fixes.
	InitKeymapInfo() changed to use KeycodeToKeysym().
	TkpSetKeycodeAndState() rewritten, mostly by copying code from
	XKeysymToKeycode().
	XKeycodeToKeysym() rewritten. Preferably it should be removed.

	EXPLANATION: The main problem is ToAscii() which has a lot of side
	effects, and also that XKeycodeToKeysym() is not provided enough
	input to do a proper job.  The changes' main goal is to avoid
	calling ToAscii() if not necessary, and to provide it with as
	correct information as possible when called.  Also some attempts
	to clean up what ToAscii() did are done.  See the code for details.

	BUGS FIXED: Typing shifted (and AltGr) dead keys did not work.
	Keyboard lock lamps did not work on Win98.
	Events regarding AltGr-keys behaved badly.
	Example: On a Swedish keyboard, $ is typed with AltGr-4.
	That keyboard event would get the keysym '4' not 'dollar'.
	Also, doing [event generete . <Key-dollar>] would send keysym '4'.
	Translation to ascii in TkpGetString did not handle return and
	tab correctly. I.e. [event generate . <Key-Return>] gave wrong %A

	* tests/text.test:

	* library/text.tcl: fixed double-click selection behavior where
	there were embedded windows/widgets in the same line. [Bug: 3989]

	* win/tkWinWm.c (TkWmProtocolEventProc): cached atom name as the
	window could get destroyed during eval [Bug: 2513]

	* tests/grid.test: Added a test for the consecutive ^ and multiple
	widget case (bug #1386).

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed interpretation of consecutive ^
	characters in grid command.  Previously, ^ ^ was interpreted as
	meaning that there must be a 2-column widget above to extend,
	neglecting the case where there was actually 2 1-column widgets
	above.  Now, ^ ^ is interpreted as a possible width; the gridder
	will consume as many ^'s as there are columns in the widget, and
	leave the rest for the extension of other widgets.  (bug #1386).

	they were causing Tk to lock up when any window on the system was
	not processing its message queue (more importantly, windows in Tcl
	and Tk).  The send command needs to be rewritten to prevent the
	deadlock situation (soon).  The dde command is being pushed into
	its own package and will provide almost all of the capabilities
	that send did before (using a "dde eval" command), not yet
	completed.

1999-03-31    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Modified dde/send code to work properly on
	Win95/Win98. String lengths are not returned properly by DDE, so
	NULL terminate all strings going in and ignore the string length
	coming back out.  Do not destroy handles until all necessary work
	on those handles (and child handles) is done.

1999-03-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkWindow.c (Tk_DestroyWindow): Image handlers are now
	finalized before the font subsystem since complex image handlers
	may contain references to fonts (e.g. Tix compound images).

	so they are consistent with respect to byte versus character
	oriented indices.  The layout functions all manipulate character
	oriented values while the lower level measurement functions all
	operate on byte oriented values.  This distinction was not clear
	and so the functions were being used improperly in a number of

	* generic/tk.decls: Eliminated uses of C++ STL types string and

	* unix/configure.in:
        --nameble-shared is now the default and builds Tk as a shared

        and shell.

1999-03-26    <surles@scriptics.com>

	* library/menu.tcl: Fixed bug reported by Bryan Oakley in the

	always a menu attached to the button.  [Bug 1116] 

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in: Removed --enable-tcl-stub.  Linking Tk to Tcl
 	stubs is causing too many problems when linking executables like wish.
  	Until the Tk is a fully loadable extension, linking against the Tcl
 	stubs is not supported in Tk.

1999-03-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tkBitmap.c:
	* generic/tkCursor.c:
	* generic/tkGC.c: When creating hash tables that key off of XID
 	handles, make sure to pass TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS.  XIDs are guaranteed
 	to be 32bit numbers, although on some 64bit systems (including 64bit
 	Solaris 7) they are packed into a 64bit value where the upper 32bits
 	are zero. The normal method of sizeof(XID)/sizeof(int) causes the
 	hash table code to assume that the XID is a pointer to an array of 
	two ints, which it is not.  Tk now supports 64bit Solaris 7.

	replaced with a macro which calls Tk_MainEx(). Tk can link to the Tcl
	stubs library, wish links directly to Tcl and Tk. Use
	--enable-tcl-stubs to link Tk to the Tcl stubs library (Unix), on
	by default on Windows. Exported all public functions through the
	stubs mechanism (see the *.decls files) and many of the internal
	functions. Most of the changes dealt with shifting around the
	function declarations in the header files.  Mac code may not
	compile, but it shouldn't take much work to fix this.
	
	* mac/tkMacMenu.c: Added dummy TkpMenuThreadInit for Mac to be
	consistent with Unix and Windows versions.
	
1999-03-08    <lfb@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Toplevel class no longer shared between 
	threads.
	
	* win/tkWinX.c: Multiple threads no longer share the same
	TkDisplay structure.  Required because TkDisplay stores much
	thread-specific data for a given thread.

	* win/tkWinSend.c: Moved application instance handle out
	out thread-local storage.  DDE was failing to initialize
	when the instance handles were different between threads.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Added THREADDEFINES for building with
	threads enabled.
	
	* generic/tkMenu.c:
	* win/tkWinMenu.c:
	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c: Added TkpMenuThreadInit for initializing
	thread-specific Menu state.

1999-03-01    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: 
	* win/tkWinPointer.c:
	* win/tkWinInt.h: Fix "focus -force" for Windows.  The Win32 API
	function SetForegroundWindow() does not work unless the window
	handle is a toplevel window (a Windows toplevel).  The handle
	being passed was a Tk toplevel, which is a child of the Windows
	toplevel.

1999-02-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/cat.c: Remove this file, use the one in the Tcl source directory.

	* win/makefile.vc: Remove the wishc.exe from the default targets.  Add
	a separate console-wish target to build it.  The need for a 
	console-wish will go away soon, so we don't want to encourage its
	use.

1999-02-25    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Properly initialize the tsdPtr->firstWindow field.
	
	* win/cat.c: Code for cat32.exe, copied from the Tcl sources. Required
	in order to run the test suite from the makefile

	* win/winMain.c: Add main() for a console-based wishc.exe, which meant
	adding code to disable the call to Tk_ConsoleInit().
	
	* generic/tkConsole.c: Check the standard handles before creating the
	new standard channels.	This allows a windows app that has stdin,
	stdout, or stderr to correctly connect to them.
	
	* generic/tkMain.c: Add a proper check for the interactive mode, since
	the standard channels may actually be connected in windows mode or
	even in the console-based wish.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Add targets for wishc.exe (console-based wish) and
	cat32.exe (for testing). Fix the test suite target so it can be run
	from the makefile (which can happen since the standard handles have
	been fixed).

1999-02-04    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Various cleanup related to the Tcl_Eval and Tcl_ObjSetVar
	changes in Tcl.
	
	INTEGRATED PATCHES FROM 8.0.5b2: 
	
	* win/tkWinMenu.c (TkpDestroyMenu): Changed so modalMenuPtr is
	cleared when it is being destroyed.

	* generic/tkImgPhoto.c: Changed so color tables are freed
	immediately instead of being delayed.  This ensures that color
	tables are properly disposed at process exit.

	* library/prolog.ps: Changed string that determines font height to
	include European character with an umlaut.

	* generic/tkImgBmap.c (ImgBmapConfigureInstance): If an image
	mask changed but ended up with the same XID, the GC failed to be
	updated and so the new mask was not used. [Bug: 970]

	* generic/tkFocus.c (SetFocus): Changed so focus window is always
	set if -force is specified.  This fixes the problem on Windows
	where Tk does not activate the window if it already has focus.

	* generic/tkConsole.c: Fixed so errors in console eval are
	reported properly.  Eliminated duplicate result messages. [Bug: 973]

	* win/tkWinWm.c: Changed so windows that aren't resizable don't
	have resize handles and the zoom box is disabled.

	* win/tkWinInt.h:
	* win/tkWinPointer.c: Changed to cancel the mouse timer when a
	user initiated move/resize loop begins.

	* unix/configure.in: TK_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS was set incorrectly if
	SHLIB_LD_LIBS='${LIBS}', and shared linking is performed through
	the C compiler. Systems affected are Linux, MP-RAS and NEXTSTEP,
	but also with gcc on many more systems. [Bug: 908]

	* win/makefile.vc: First stab at install target.  Fixed quoting so
	paths with spaces work.
	
	* tests/main.test:
	* tests/unixWm.test: Better cleanup of temporary files.
	
	* mac/tkMacAppInit.c:
	* generic/tkTest.c:
	* generic/tkAppInit.c:
	* win/winMain.c: Changed some EXTERN declarations to extern
	since they are not defining exported interfaces.  This avoids
	generating useless declspec() attributes and makes the windows
	makefile simpler.

	* library/menu.tcl (tkMenuFind): Changed so keyboard shortcuts
	will only be found in the current toplevel.  Previously, they
	might be found in menus attached to other toplevels that might not
	even be mapped. [Bug: 924]

	* generic/tkCanvLine.c: Changed to treat zero width lines like
	they have width 1 for purposes of selection. [Bug: 925]

	* win/tkWinFont.c (Tk_MeasureChars): Added a workaround for a bug
	in GetTextExtentExPoint on Win NT 4.0/Japanese. [Bug: 1006]

	* unix/tkUnixSend.c (Tk_SetAppName): Fixed uninitialized memory
	access bug. [Bug: 919]

1999-1-28    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkGrid.c: Fixed bug in "grid forget" that failed to cancel
	pending idle handlers, resulting in a crash in a few odd cases.

1999-01-06  <lfb@JUSTICE>

	* generic/tk.h, generic/tkGet.c, generic/tkConfig.c, 
	* generic/tkOldConfig.c, generic/tkEntry.c, generic/tkMenubutton.c, 
	* generic/tkMenubutton.h, generic/tkScale.c, generic/tkScale.h, 
	* generic/tkTextDisplay.c, generic/tkText.c, unix/tkUnixMenubu.c, 
	* unix/tkUnixScale.c, mac/tkMacMenu.c, mac/tkMacMenubutton.c, 
	
	Removed global Tk_Uids dealing with "-state" configuration option
	and added new TK_CONFIG_STATE configSpec that doesn't use 
	Tk_Uids.

1998-12-11    === Tk 8.1b1 Release ===
	
1998-12-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkMain.c (Tk_Main): Fixed improper command line encoding
	handling. 

1998-12-08    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tkWinClipboard.c (TkSelGetSelection, TkWinClipboardRender):
	Changed to handle multibyte characters properly. [Bug: 935]

1998-12-07    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/xmfbox.tcl (tkMotifFDialog_Create): In the cached case,
	the data array was not being initialized with the correct set of
	widgets.

1998-12-4    <welch@SAGE>

	* Changed patchLevel to 8.1b1

	* generic/tkMenu.c (ConfigureMenuCloneEntries): The -menu configuration
	option was being incorrectly specified as just "menu". 

1998-11-30    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tkButton.c (ConfigureButton): The error result was
	getting lost when restoring configuration options. [Bug: 619]

1998-11-25    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/tkUnixFont.c (GetFontAttributes): Initialize an unspecified
	family to an empty string.
	(FontMapLoadPage): if the font included characters below 32, the
	index computation was incorrect because the range was shifted up
	to 32.
	(CreateClosestFont): check for empty locale as well as NULL.

	* generic/tkFont.c (TkFontParseXLFD): initialize charset to
	iso8859-1 if no charset is specified.

	* mac/tkMacHLEvents.c (OdocHandler): added conversion from
	external string to UTF [Bug: 869]

	* integrated tk8.0.4 changes.
	
	* generic/tkBind.c: fixed deletion order bug where a crash would
	result if a binding deleted "."

	* generic/tkMenu.c (MenuWidgetObjCmd): disabled menu entries were
	getting reenabled whenever the mouse passed over the entry [Bug: 860]

	* unix/tkUnixMenu.c (TkpComputeStandardMenuGeometry): hidemargin
	option was not honored properly in menus [Bug: 859]

1998-11-24    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMacMenu.c, tkUnixMenu.c, tkWinMenu.c, tkMenuDraw.c, tkMenu.h,
	* tkMenu.c: Backed out the previous fix for bug 620 and
	eliminated a bunch of code that created unnecessary objects.
	Changed back to using internal types instead of objects for many
	configuration options.	There are many more fixes like this that
	could be made, but some require a little restructuring of the
	code. In any case the leaks are fixed and there is a lot less
	allocation happening. [Bug: 620]

1998-11-19    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tkMenu.c (DestroyMenuEntry): fixed memory leaks [Bug: 620]
	
	* tkWinX.c (GetTranslatedKey): fixed bad code merge

	* tkWinWm.c, tkWinMenu.c: fixed titles and menus so they properly
	display Unicode [Bug: 819]
