# TESTFILE INITIALIZATION
#

if {[namespace exists ::tk::test]} {
    # All test files, including this one, are evaluated in the current interpreter
    # (-singleproc 1). The file "main.tcl" has already been sourced into this
    # interpreter by all.tcl.
} else {
    # This test file is evaluated inside its own separate process/interpreter
    # (-singleproc 0).
    #
    # Load the main script "main.tcl", which takes care of:
    # - setup for the application and the root window
    # - importing commands from the tcltest namespace
    # - loading of the testutils mechanism along with its utility procs
    # - loading of Tk specific test constraints (additionally to constraints
    #   provided by the package tcltest)
