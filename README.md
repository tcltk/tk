This directory contains the sources and documentation for Tk, a
cross-platform GUI toolkit implemented with the Tcl scripting language.

For details on features, incompatibilities, and potential problems with

historical record of all changes to Tk.

Tk is maintained, enhanced, and distributed freely by the Tcl community.
Source code development and tracking of bug reports and feature requests
take place at [core.tcl-lang.org](https://core.tcl-lang.org/).

Tk is a freely available open-source package.  You can do virtually
anything you like with it, such as modifying it, redistributing it,
and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the file
